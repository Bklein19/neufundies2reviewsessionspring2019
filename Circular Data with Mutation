// CIRCULAR DATA WITH MUTATION

//	Revisit Part 2 (Methods for Structured Data) in Lab 2. Adapt this problem to use an abstract class APet that implements IPet,
//
//	and have each pet class extend APet. Abstract what you can into APet. Also add a "Person owner;" field into APet and adjust your examples and methods appropriately.
//
//	 
//
//	Define a void method that appends a given Deque<T> to the end of this Deque<T>. How would you write tests for this? Are there any instances where this method fails to work as expected?
